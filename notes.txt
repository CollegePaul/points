On Pi:
Enable I2C in raspi config

Edit bootconfig:  (it was in:  sudo nano /boot/config.txt)
but is now in:
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt

set the dtparams to on  (uncomment them) to  enable hardware interfaces.

I did a reboot

Make VENV
Install smbus2
Install flask
Install flask_socketio

Arduino code in nano.io

Test coms_test.py to check I2C

Check flask and buttons with
with templates/index.html

main program:
server.py
templates/map.html

i use a shell script to start it all running, run_server.sh  this is not actually in points folder, but 1 level above.

_____________  TO DO _______________

Cant seem to get the flask sever to aways stop correctly,  do not shut program down with CTRL-Z this only kills the python script,
always use CRTL-C

will try to get the program to get its own PID, and use this if needed


ps aux | grep -i python           -shows python processes
ps aux | grep -i flask

pkill pid                         - use the pid from above
pkill -n python                   - kill python processes  (newest process)
